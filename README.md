3. Methodology:

a. Numerical Methods:

Finite Difference Method (FDM): Used to discretize the heat equation. The spatial and temporal domains are divided into discrete grid points.
Explicit and Implicit Schemes: Both methods are explored to solve the discretized equations, with stability and convergence considerations.
b. Initial and Boundary Conditions:

Initial Condition: The initial temperature distribution is specified across the medium.
Boundary Conditions: Dirichlet or Neumann boundary conditions are applied to define the temperature or heat flux at the boundaries of the domain.
4. Implementation:

a. Setting Up the Grid:

Define the spatial and temporal resolution.
Initialize the temperature grid with the initial condition.
b. Iterative Solvers:

Implement the explicit and implicit schemes to update the temperature field at each time step.
Use libraries such as NumPy for numerical computations and Matplotlib for visualizations.
c. Visualization:

Plot the temperature distribution at various time steps to visualize the heat propagation.
Generate animations to observe the dynamic evolution of the temperature field.
5. Results:

a. Temperature Profiles:

Display temperature distribution at different time intervals.
Compare results from explicit and implicit methods.
b. Stability Analysis:

Discuss the stability criteria for the numerical schemes.
Highlight the Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy (CFL) condition for the explicit method.
c. Convergence and Accuracy:

Analyze the convergence of the numerical solution to the analytical or expected solution.
Calculate errors and discuss the accuracy of the methods.
6. Conclusion:
